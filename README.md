**ChillHub Unboxing**
After your refrigerator is unboxed, there are a few things you need to do. 

1. Place the ChillHub computer either on the top or back of your refrigerator. Double sided tape has been provided and will securely fasten the computer to the refrigerator. 
2. There are two USB cords coming out of the back of the refrigerator. Plug these into the ChillHub computer that you mounted on step 1. They are standard USB ports.
3. Plug the power adapter into the ChillHub computer. 
4. Plug in any accessories you have purchased.
